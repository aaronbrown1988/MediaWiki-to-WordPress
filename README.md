# MediaWiki-to-WordPress
MediaWiki to WordPress Converter based on http://www.analogrithems.com/rant/portfolio/mediawiki2wordpress/

I have added some very rough code to convert URLs, Images, Media, and flag up (with __FIXME__) things that are noticed but not handled. You should use with caution. This code has had almost no testing.

No responsibiltiy of ruining your website, etc., you're on your own with this.
